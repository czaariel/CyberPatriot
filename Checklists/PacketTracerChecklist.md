### Module 2: Network Protocols and Communications

Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form, for transmission. Decoding reverses this process in order to interpret the information. Data is broken down into `frames` to make easier to handle. 

1. Protocols must account for the following requirements
    * an identified sender and receiver
    * common language and grammar
    * speed and timing of delivery
    * conformation or acknowledgement requirements
1. Message Delivery Options
    * `Unicast`: a one-to-one delivery option, meaning there is only a single destination for the message
    * `Multicast`: a one-to-many delivery of the same message to a group of host destinations simultaneously
    * `Broadcast`: one-to-all message delivery option where all hosts on the network need to receive the message at the same time
